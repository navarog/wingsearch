# Contributing to supporting other languages

If you own the game in other language which is not fully translated (or you have found a typo) and want to contribute, I'd really appreciate that. To make the whole process the easiest, please follow the next steps.

* If the language is already partially translated, simply download the corresponding file from above. If not, copy the file [`template.xlsx`](template.xlsx) and name it according to respective [ISO 639-1 2-letter language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (e.g. for german it would be `de.xlsx`) and save it in this folder.

* Fill the necessary information in the file. Do not change any predefined cells. The file consists of 3 sheets. 

* **Pay attention to the following format.** Specify icons in card descriptions using their name inside of square brackets.

E.g. for American Bittern (*Botaurus lentiginosus*), the power text in english looks like this: `Player(s) with the fewest [wetland] birds: draw 1 [card].`

Below you find the table of all needed icons and their codes.
